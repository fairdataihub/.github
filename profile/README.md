## Making FAIR data practices more accessible 🌟

The [FAIR Data Principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) are a set of guidelines designed to make research data more easily reusable by both humans and machines. 🤖

These practices are essential for ensuring the reproducibility of scientific findings, promoting the reuse of data, and enabling AI/ML-driven analysis to accelerate the pace of new discoveries. They also ensure that data generators receive proper credit. Despite efforts from funding agencies, industry, and researchers, FAIR data practices are not yet widely adopted due to their complexity, insufficient support for researchers, and lack of awareness. 🤯

To address these challenges, we develop open-source tools that automate and simplify FAIR data practices for biomedical researchers, providing intuitive user interfaces for easy adoption. 💻

## About Us 🧑‍💼

FAIR Data Innovations Hub is a division of the [California Medical Innovations Institute](https://calmi2.org/) (CalMI2), a non profit biomedical research organization located in San Diego, California. We have a multidisciplinary team of enthusiasts about FAIR Data practices and software development. 🤓
